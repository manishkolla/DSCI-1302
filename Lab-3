'''
    Mean is used to get the average value among a large sum of values. It helps
    to analyze and compare an individual with the entire set of data

    Median is mostly used to get the central tendency of the data
    it helps in getting the middle value of the data which
    helps in predicting the average

    Mode is used to get the frequency of the numbers. it
    is used to get the most recurring element in the entire data

    Standard deviation is used to get the deviation when comparing
    multiple items with each other. In real life it is used by real 
    estate agants for variation

    Sometimes standard devaition may be negative, at that time 
    variance can be used to make it a positive number. It is also used to 
    get the difference between each number and the mean of the entire data
